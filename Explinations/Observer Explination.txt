The Observer would be used to monitor when the player reaches a high evnough altitude to activate the bonus stage (8 levels high).

A simple StartBonusStage() event would exist that would lock the cameras height (no longer following the player as they ascend),
and spawn the bonus fruits for the player to collect.


The Subject class would hold a list of all those listening for its notifications, whe the player reaches the required altitude
te class will begin it's Notify() function

the Notify() fuction cycles through all those Observers listening to the Subject and calls each of their OnNotify() Functions

Upon having their OnNotify() function called the observer would activate the prior mentioned StartBonusStage() to begin
the related events.
