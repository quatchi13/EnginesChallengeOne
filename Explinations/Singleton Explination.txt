The Health Management Singleton doesn't manage health, but rather lives.
It keeps track of the current number of lives at all times.

It contains to functions: Damage(int) and Heal(int)

Calling Damage will remove the passed value from the current lives count.

Calling heal will add the passed value to th current lives count

If the lives ever reach or go below 0 the player will be destroyed.

This gives the game a losing state (although it doesn't have a way to restart implemented)
