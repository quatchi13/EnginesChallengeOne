Command is not fully implemented into the game.

I focused the use of command not onto the bricks as those remain broken even between the two unique players to allow for collaboration
as levels progress.

Instead I wanted to use command to Undo the deletion of icicles.

Hypothetically when the player would run out of lives and the second player would be starting their turn within Start()
all the icicles that was removed would be replaced.

The undo command allow the game to only replace those iciles that were actually removed rather than overriting all icicles.

this can slightly optimise performance and postpone the memory issues that would come from the creation and deletion of objects.
